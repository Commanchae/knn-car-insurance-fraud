## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to apply the K-nearest-neighbors algorithm on a dataset regarding car insurance fraud claims in order to classify claims as either fradulent or non-fradulent based on the details of the claim. 

## About the Data ðŸ“–
The dataset was most likely modified from [Somnath Banerjee's kaggle dataset.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/somjee/auto-insurance-customerlifetimevalue/discussion) It was modified for use within Monash University Clayton's ETC1000 unit as teaching material. 

The dataset contains 18 columns, with a mix of categorical and discrete variables.
